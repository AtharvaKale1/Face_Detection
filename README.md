# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV

Welcome to the **Face Detection** project! This project demonstrates a simple and effective way to detect human faces in real-time using a webcam and OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. Ideal for beginners in computer vision and Python.

## 📌 Features

* 🚀 Real-time face detection via webcam
* 🧠 Uses Haar Cascade Classifier (pre-trained)
* 🔍 Bounding boxes drawn around detected faces
* 🐍 Python and OpenCV-based implementation
* 🎓 Great for educational & demo purposes

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool        | Purpose               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Python      | Programming Language  |
| OpenCV      | Image Processing & CV |
| Jupyter Lab | Notebook-based IDE    |

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Initialize Webcam** – Captures video frames in real-time.
2. **Load Haar Cascade** – Uses OpenCV’s face detection classifier.
3. **Process Each Frame** – Detect faces and draw rectangles.
4. **Display Output** – Shows live video with face boxes.
